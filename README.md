# Cache_Simulator
 * A cache simulator that can replay traces (from Valgrind) and output
 * statistics for the number of hits, misses, and evictions.
 * The replacement policy is LRU.

 * Implementation and assumptions:
    1. Each load/store can cause at most 1 cache miss plus a possible eviction.
    2. Instruction loads (I) are ignored.
    3. Data modify (M) is treated as a load followed by a store to the same
    address. Hence, an M operation can result in two cache hits, or a miss and a
    hit plus a possible eviction.
